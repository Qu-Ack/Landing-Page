# Landing-Page

We will try making a landing page from scatch in this project. I will be using flex box because that's all I know right now. hopefully it turns out to be great.

I finally finished the landing page. I learned a lot about flex. I wouldn't call my self a master of flexbox just yet tho. There's still a lot to learn and lot of fun. 

After the final completition 1 landing page was :
220 lines of CSS
99 lines of HTML 

WOW! IT took around 2hours to make.
